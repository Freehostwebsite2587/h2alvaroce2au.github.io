# 👋 Hi, I'm Henry Alvaro

**Civil Engineer | QA/QC Specialist | MRT & Infrastructure Projects | NSW Subclass 190 Visa Granted**

With over **18 years** of hands-on experience in major infrastructure projects across Singapore — including MRT stations, road tunnels, and viaducts — I specialize in Quality Assurance and Control, civil site supervision, and stakeholder coordination. My strengths lie in delivering ISO-compliant systems, managing audits, and ensuring safety and quality outcomes across complex civil packages.

I hold a Subclass 190 Permanent Residency for New South Wales, and I’m actively exploring roles in Sydney’s infrastructure boom — particularly metro, road, and utilities projects.
